Hello there!

Begin the application by clicking Game, then Load Game,
then navigate to the file which you would like to load.

There is a help bar located in Tools that provides additional information.

You can set configurations by clicking the configuration 
menu item and you can set colors using the color bar in 
the top right. 

You can jump to any tick by using the Go To tool. You can 
also go forward and backward by using the next and back buttons.

You can save all ticks up to the current or save a range of ticks 
by using save range.

When you go forward through the game, cells that are alive for 
consecutive ticks fade lighter and lighter. However, if you go 
backwards, the opacity resets and the cells revert to their normal 
RGB standard color.

Configurations are saved upon application close inside 'src' folder.
The application loads data from the _CONFIG_.txt file, do not 
move it or edit its contents. It will save the first tick of the grid 
you last had opened as well as the output file location and name, and 
also the color of the grid.
