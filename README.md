# Conway's Game of Life

Navigate to the scripts folder to find 2 ```.cmd``` files. The one labeled ```javadocHW2```
will run the application on a Windows system. The other will generate Javadocs
for the application code.

## Note
The game is not playable until you load in a text file to build the grid. If you navigate to
the ```samples``` folder you can test with sample input files. Settings such as output file
name pattern, output file location, color, row count, column count, and the starting grid
are saved to a ```_CONFIG_.txt``` file. These settings will persist between application sessions.
